**Nifty 50 Current Price Scraping and Analysis**

The "Nifty 50 Current Price Scraping and Analysis" project involves developing a Python-based tool to scrape live stock prices of Nifty 50 companies from financial websites. Using libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`, the script will gather real-time data and store it in a structured format. The data will then be analyzed to identify trends, patterns, and significant price movements. Visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` will help in presenting the insights. Additionally, the project will incorporate measures to handle potential issues such as IP blocking and will ensure compliance with web scraping best practices. This project aims to provide a comprehensive tool for monitoring and analyzing the performance of Nifty 50 stocks in real-time.
